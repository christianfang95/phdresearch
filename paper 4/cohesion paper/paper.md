# Introduction
Divorce and stepfamily formation are common in modern societies [@raley_divorce_2020]. When parents repartner, they are faced with multiple challenges. For example, parents need to learn to live with a new partner and, at the same time, often feel responsible for fostering good relationships between their child and their new partner, who becomes - at least by definition - the child’s stepparent [@jensen2017transitioning]. Such processes of family reorganization are often complex and difficult, which is why parents might find it difficult to feel that their stepfamily is cohesive [@ganong2019stepfathers @pink1985problem @waldren1990cohesion].
Stepfamily cohesion refers to an overall perception of unity, closeness, and meaningful involvement regarding one’s stepfamily [@komter2006strength @waldren1990cohesion @jensen2022associations]. It is the feeling that one’s stepfamily is a coherent and supportive unit, rather than a disjoint patchwork [@favez2015coparenting]. 

Cohesion is conceptually closely related to family belonging (i.e., individuals’ feelings that they are part of the family; see @king2015adolescents). Feelings of cohesion are important to investigate due to their contribution to family functioning and family members’ well-being. 
Divorced parents can profit from a more cohesive stepfamily in terms of higher perceived well-being and lower stress levels [@waldren1990cohesion]. This can, in turn, positively affect their parenting, which benefits their children [@king2015adolescents]. Children growing up in more cohesive stepfamilies have been found to exhibit fewer behavioral problems and score higher on subjective well-being [@shigeto2014roles].

The limited literature on stepfamily cohesion has mostly focused on the consequences of (a lack of) stepfamily cohesion [e.g., @duncan1994effects @hong2015interactive @shigeto2014roles]. The few studies that consider factors contributing to perceptions of cohesion are usually limited to considering the influences of the relationship qualities between stepfamily member [e.g., @jensen2022associations] and study cohesion only in the most common stepfamily type (i.e., resident stepfather families, see e.g., xxx).

The stereotypical resident stepfather family has, however, become less of a default stepfamily constellation in recent years. Stepfamilies have considerably diversified, for example in terms of residence arrangements. Nowadays, an increasing share of parents opt for shared residence arrangements (i.e., joint physical custody) or (to a lesser extent) sole father residence. Consequently, more parents experience their children living only part-time with them or mostly with their ex-partners, which can have important ramifications for how cohesive parents perceive their stepfamily. For example, shared resident parents might be less inclined to perceive their stepfamilies as cohesive due to their child constantly moving between their own household and that of their ex-partner. This picture can become even more complicated when one considers that in many postdivorce stepfamilies parents have a shared biological child with the new partner, and their new partners can also have children from their previous relationship, who also follow a residence arrangement. Such postdivorce stepfamily diversity is pivotal to consider as it could reveal stepfamily constellations that are particularly prone to be considerd as less cohesive than others, with potentially detrimental consequences for parents and their children living in those types of stepfamilies. 

In this study, we comprehensively investigate parents’ perceptions of stepfamily cohesion in diverse stepfamilies using large-scale survey data. We, first, consider differences between parents who do and who do not have a shared biological child with their current partners vis-a-vis perceptions of cohesion. Second, we consider parents' biological child's and potential stepchildrens' residence arrangements. For this study, we used the third wave of the New Families in the Netherlands (NFN) survey, collected in 2020 (N=3,056). NFN is a longitudinal survey based on a probability sample of Dutch parents who divorced or separated in 2009/10. Using this data provides the unique opportunity to investigate parents’ feelings of cohesion across a wide range of postdivorce families, such as those with shared residence arrangements.


# Theoretical Background

In the following, we outline our theoretical arguments regarding how and why postdivorce stepfamily structure could influence parents' perceptions of stepfamily cohesion. Our arguments are phrased from the vantage point of a "focal parent" (i.e., the respondent), who has a child from a previous relationship and is currently in a stable (i.e., cohabitational or marital) relationship with their current partner. The current partner can also have a stepchild, and the focal parent can have a biological child with their current partner. In other words, the focal parents we are investigating are part of stepfamilies where there are one or two stepchildren, and possibly a halfsibling. We are only considering stepfamilies in which at least one of the children from the focal parents' or current partner's former relationship is (part)time resident in focal parents' household. This is because stepfamily cohesion likely applies less to stepfamily situations without any resident children.

We, first, elaborate on differences between residence arrangements (i.e., sibling complexity) before elaborating on potential differences between focal parents who do and do not have a shared biological child with their current partners vis-a-vis cohesion.



## Household/sibling structure

Both the focal parent's existing biological child and their current partner's potential child from a previous union can be (part-time) residential or nonresidential. Excluding the scenario where both children are nonresidential, the combinations of both children's residence arrangements yield three distinct scenarios or household structures.

The first scenario - and most simple - scenario is that there is only one residential child (from the focal parent), but no stepchild (i.e., the current partner does not have a child from their previous union). In such a stepfamily, it might be comparatively easy to foster stepfamily cohesion. While establishing relationships between stepparents and stepchildren is usually a difficult process, it might be easier if there is only one new family member that needs to be integrated (i.e., only the current partner). This process might be relatively easy if the child is residential, as the stepparent might have many opportunities for engaging with the child. If this goes well, the focal parent could be relatively optimistic about the state of their stepfamily. Furthermore, if the child is residential, parents have many opportunities to create a sense of family belonging and cohesion by performing family routines and rituals together. On the other hand, many stepparents and stepchildren do not get along, and such conflicts can become all the more salient if stepparents and their stepchildren reside in the same household. However, coresidence allows comparatively many opportunities for working through such conflicts and establishing a cordial relationship. 

In the second scenario, both the focal parent and their current partner have a residential biological child from a previous union. Phrased differently, the household consists of two residential stepchildren. Life in such a stepfamily might be more complex than in simple stepfamilies that only comprise one stepchild. For once, both the focal parent and their current partner need to get to know their new stepchild and simultaneously adopt the role of a stepparent. This can be an often long, difficult, and at times frustrating process, that both (step)parents go through at the same time. On the other hand, both children being residential gives all stepfamily members ample opportunities to get to know one another and build family routines, which are important for creating perceptions of stepfamily cohesion and belonging. Furthermore, all stepfamily members residing in the same household allows for a distinct family identity to be developed, as there are relatively few ties to the respective "old" families. However, it is not guaranteed that all family members get along, and it is common for stepsiblings to have contentious and conflictual relationships. Parents might pick up on such conflict, which might negatively influence their assessment of their stepfamily. Therefore, parents might assess stepfamilies with two residential children as less cohesive than those with only one child to begin with. 

<!-- Two residential children: symmetrical; 
-> more difficult: both children need to get to know each other, it is not guaranteed that they will get along
-> partner also needs to get to know stepchild, both parents become stepparents -> more stressful
-> can integrate them into routines -> easier to create a new family
-> clear separation from previous family
--> 


The third scenario involves one of the children being residential, and the other child being nonresidential. In other words, the children's residence arrangements are assymmetrical. For various reasons, assymmetrical residence arrangements can be challenging and lead parents to perceive their stepfamilies as less cohesive. For once, whereas it is easy to build stepfamily cohesion through family rituals and routines when children are residential, this is more difficult when one of the children is nonresidential. Practicing routines and rituals becomes more difficult and less-self evident, for example as more planning is necessary (e.g., when is the nonresidential child at home?). This also implies that, if one of the children is nonresidential, that parent might to some extent still be involved in their "old family", which can lead to a less clear separation between the "old" and the "new" family. Family boundaries might, as a result, also be less clear. Assymmetries in residence arrangements can, furthermore, also evoke feelings of guilt. For example, if the focal parent's child is residential but their current partner's child is not, they might feel guilty about being able to spend so much time with their child while their partner cannot do the same. Conversely, if the focal parent is the nonresident parent, the current partner might feel guilty about them not getting to see their child a lot, which can spill over into focal parents' assessment of their stepfamily as cohesive.

Based on these arguments, we expect *stepfamilies with a resident child and no stepchild to be perceived as most cohesive, followed by stepfamilies with two residential children, and, lastly, stepfamilies with a residential and a nonresidential child* (H1a).

These three scenarios can be further complicated by taking into account that either child or both children might follow a shared residence arrangment (i.e., they are part-time resident). In case of shared residence, the child in question constantly moves between the household of the focal parent and that of the (current partner's) ex-partner. This implies that focal parents' (and their partners') access to the children in question is limited, compared to if the children resided full time-in their household, which can make it difficult to practice family routines and rituals that involve all core stepfamily members. Additionally, in case of shared residence, parents might, to an extent, be still  entangled in their "previous" families. Aspects of the child's life - financial matters, division of holidays etc. - need to be constantly negotiated with the ex-partner(s). Resultingly, parents might not feel like they have a cohesive stepfamily or they might be confused about who belongs to their family in the first place. We, therefore hypothesize that *if either or both the biological child or stepchild are part-time resident, perceptions of cohesion will be lower* (H1b).


<!-- 
-> might apply equally to all types -> all - 

Such a negative effect of shared residence on perceptions of cohesion might especially apply in the scenario of both children being (part-time) resident (so the third scenario).

First scenario: only one schedule to keep in mind
Aysmmetrical: it is already assymm, so not too much of an additional burden? 
Res res: could be two part-time res! Very stressful? Very unclear if both children follow a shared residence arrangmeent 


-> less access to the child -> difficult to create family routines together, fewer bonding opportunites with the stepchild in particular which create cohesion

-> in and out means more negotiation with the ex-partners: so less clear separation old vs new, but also unclear boundaries -> boundary ambiguity




<!-- 
For sake of simplicity, we distinguish between three scenarios. In the first scenario, the focal parent only has a (part-time) resident biological child and no stepchild. 

In the second scenario, the focal parent has a (part-time) resident biological child as well as a (part-time) resident stepchild. In other words, the biological child's and stepchild's residence arrangements are symmetrical.

In the third scenario, the focal parent's biological child and stepchild have different - asymmetrical - residence arrangements, meaning that one of the two children resides (part-time) with the focal parent and the other child is nonresident. 

Parents' perceptions of cohesion likely vary substantially between these three scenarios. 

Stepfamily constellations in which there is only one child (so the first scenario) are probably experienced as most cohesive. 

Asymmetry: guilt about self or other parent 


-->

# Halfsibling

In stepfamilies, having a shared biological child has a high symbolic value for parents, above and beyond fulfilling the desire for (further) offspring. For example, the commitment hypothesis, having a shared biological child is used to signal commitment to each other: focal parents (and their ex-partners) might want to have a child together to show to each other that they are "serious" about their new relationship, that they have moved on from their prior unions, and that they wish to focus on their new family. Additionally, per the uncertainty reduction hypothesis, having a shared child might be a delibrate strategy to reduce uncertainty about the new relationship. Stepfamilies are considered less institutionalized than "first-time, two biological parents families", which might mean that parents feel ambiguity regarding the roles and boundaries in their stepfamilies. By reproducing, the stepfamily becomes more alike a first-time family, which can make roles, boundaries, norms, and values clearer, which can lead to more positive assessments of stepfamily cohesion. Relatedly, the birth of a biological child can tightly integrate all family members, as the birth of a further biological child establishes blood ties between all stepfamily members. For example, whereas many parents perceive their current partners (i.e., the stepparent) to be outsiders, having a biological child with them can integrate them more tightly into the existing stepfamily and make them a "real" family member. Parents' children from their prior relationships become biologically related to the new child (as halfsiblings), which might lead to closer and more amicable bonds between them. Thus, the birth of a shared biological child can evoke in the focal parent the perception that their stepfamily is now "complete" and tight-knit and "cemented" - thus, cohesive. 

On the other hand, there are also reasons to assume that the birth of a common biological child might not substantially change - or even decrease - the extent to which stepfamilies are perceived as cohesive. For once, the birth of a mutual child does not necessarily lead stepparents to invest more in their stepchildren, which implies that one of the parents (probably the mother) has to care for both their stepchild as well as their biological child(ren). This can be stressful and evoke perceptions of unfairness. Thus, the reduced uncertainty might also be a curse and shoulder even more burden on on of the parents, which could reduce perceptions of cohesion. Furthermore, the birth of a shared child can also induce conflict among stepfamily members. For example, the existing biological children might be opposed to the birth of the child, or they might feel "second class children" as parental attention and investments might shift towards the newborn. Resultingly, they might feel resentment towards their (step)parents. Focal parents might pick up on such conflicts, which can reduce their perceptions of stepfamily cohesion. 

Prior research and theoretical arguments thus paint a mixed picture. Ganong and Coleman concluded that while there is not much evidence that a concrete baby "works" in the way parents might intend, they argued that a concrete baby might still "work" as intended due to cognitive bias: parents might post hoc argue that "they had a child, therefore it was the right decision". We, thus, assume that *Parents who have a shared biological child assess their stepfamilies as more cohesive than those who do not have a biological child* (H2).


<!-- In sum, per these theoretical reasonings, having a shared child might be an indication that parents a) want to signal their commitment to one another, b) they wish to bring family members together 


-> Signal commitment
-> Uncertainty reduction
-> More tightly integrates partner into family
-> percolator effect: bring family members together

-> make it feel like a real family
-> not just about the parents but also the kids: does something for the family as a whole
-> symbolyszes the continuity of the family: you might only have another child if you are very sure of your relationship


 -> symbolic value
 -> given as tips to parents to "cement their family" -> can bias how they look at their family (see Ganong)

-> Little evidence, some evidence on relationship quality. Ganong and coleman: can still affect perceptions, even if only as a bias





In sum, 












 We present our arguments from the vantage point of a so-called "focal parents" (i.e., the respondents of the NFN survey). The focal parents are all divorced and have a biological child from their previous relationship, who follows a residence arrangement (sole mother/father residence or shared residence). Subsequently, the focal parents entered a stable, coresidential relationship (i.e., they cohabit or a married).

We start by describing the potential influence that having a shared biological child has on perceptions of cohesion, before describing potential group differences between focal parents' biological children's residence arrangements and residence arrangements of the stepchild (i.e., children from the current partners' former union).

## Having a shared biological child

Upwards trends in remarriage and multipartner fertility imply that many repartnered parents go on to having a shared biological child with their current partner. That new child becomes the halfsibling of parents' children from their prior unions. For two main reasons, having such a shared biological child can increase parents' perceptions of stepfamily cohesion.
<-- 
<!-- Argument 1: relationship quality -->
One line of argument is based on the presence of a shared biological child influencing perceptions of cohesion via relationship quality. As has been frequently stated in form of the "concrete baby" hypothesis, parents might deliberately seek to have a biological child with their current partner to improve and stabilize the relationship with him or her. While doing so has been shown to have have negative consequences of their existing biological childrens' well-being [@sanner2018half], studies investigating the effect of having shared children on parents' relationship quality with their partner found a positive association [@ivanova2019cementing]. And as relationship satisafction has, in turn, been consistently demonstrated to increase perceptions of stepfamily cohesion [@jensen2022associations @king2015adolescents @king2016factors], one would expect that having a shared biological child is positively related to perceptions of cohesion.

<!-- Argument 2: Changes family perceptions and norms on a more general level --->
Another line of argument is based on shared children changing parents' family values and perceptions of their family in a more systemic way. The birth of a shared biological child is a subtantial family structure transition, that prompts all family members to renegotiate role, boundaries, expectations, shared norms and values, and family rituals and routines [@coleman2013resilience]. For example, whereas roles and boundaries in stepfamilies tend to be permeable and - to an extent - ambiguous [@fine1992perceived], the birth of a common child can clarify roles and boundaries as stepfamily members become biologically related to one another [@anderson1999sibling @pasley1989boundary]. This is in line with findings from studies showing that the birth of a common child reduces uncertainty about one's family [@downs2004family @friedman1994theory], leading to more positve evaluations of ones family. Having a shared child might also make shared norms and values more explicit, as norms towards biologically related kin are stronger than those towards non-related kin. Overall, the birth of a shared child might give parents the impression that their family is now "real", as it corresponds more closely to the societal sterotype of what a family is, i.e., the nuclear family. Therefore, we hypothesize that:

H1: Parents who have a shared biological child with their partner perceive higher extents of stepfamily cohesion than those who do not have a shared child.


## Residence of Focal Parent's Biological Child

Whereas focal parents' potential children with their current partners will - by definition - live in their common household, their biological children with their previous partners and potential stepchildren (so their current partner's biological children from their previous relationship) can follow different postdivorce residence arrangements. 

### Residence of Focal Parents' Biological Child with the Previous Partner
In the Netherlands, three residence arrangements are common: sole mother residence (about two thirds), shared residence (i.e., joint physical custody; about one quarter), and sole father residence [@poortman2017shared]. Therefore, the focal parent might be a resident parent (i.e., the biological child resides mostly in his/her household), a nonresident parent (i.e., the biological child might reside mostly in the household of the ex-partner), or a part-time resident parent (i.e., the child lives about half of the time in the focal parent's and half of the time in the ex-partner's household).

Nonresident parents likely perceive the lowest extent of stepfamily cohesion. For once, nonresident parents' contact opportunities with their biological children are inherently limited - nonresident parents typically see their children only every (other) weekend [@kelly2007children]. This limited contact might mean that nonresident parents could feel that they are missing out on a substantial part of their children's lives and feel that they are the "unimportant parent" [@kielty2005mothers @stewart1999disneyland]. Furthermore, they also have fewer opportunities for forming a new stepfamily comprising their biological child, their current partner, and themselves due to time constraints or their children resisting such attempts [@jensen2015perceived]. In sum, due to their child living mostly outside of their own household, nonresident parents might in fact consider their stepfamily as factually nonexistent, let alone cohesive [@kielty2005mothers].

The growing group of part-time resident parents faces unique challenges in creating stepfamily cohesion. One the one hand, their child resides part-time in their own household, which gives focal parents greater opportunities to create a stepfamily, for example by incorporating their children into new family routines. On the other hand, shared residence arrangements imply that the stepfamily is constantly in flux [@carlsund2014swedish]. Parents might experience their child constantly "entering and leaving" their family as stressful, as they have to regularly switch between a life with and without their child. Though some parents might appreciate such a clear distinction between time with and without their children [@botterman2015social], for others the lack of stability and temporal compartmentalization of family life might make it difficult for parents to feel a sense of cohesion. 

Resident parents' stepfamily situation corresponds most closely to what societal family values prescibe a family should look like: a couple plus a child living in the same household. This arrangement, thus, corresponds most closely to the pre-divorce situation, especially in terms of contact oppotunities. Resident parents see their children almost every day and can easily engage in family routines and rituals with them, such as having shared dinners [@bakker2015family @waller2014residential]. Taken together, these factors could give focal parents the feeling that they are a "real", cohesive, stepfamily [@weaver2010caught]. We, thus, hypothesize that:
<!-- also need to say somethign about the stepparent -->

H2a: Resident focal parents perceive the highest extent of stepfamily cohesion, followed by part-time resident focal parents, and, lastly, nonresident focal parents.

### Having and Residence of Stepchildren

Whether focal parents have stepchildren and in which household they live likely substantially affects perceptions of stepfamily cohesion. If the current partner of the focal parent also has a child from a previous relationship, logically, both the focal parent and their current partner are simultaneously biological parents and stepparents. 

One the one hand, this means that both the focal parent and the current partner have to adjust to not only their new partner, but also their new stepchild, which can be demanding [@allan2011stepmothering]. 

On the other hand, both partners already having a child creates a level playing field [@fine1996clarity]. They both know what it means to be a parent (i.e., their roles are clear), which might reduce frictions and lead to both parents being more meaningfully involved with each other and their respective stepchildren.

The extent to which this might be beneficial for parents' perceptions of cohesion likely depends on where their stepchild lives. Nonresident focal parents' might perceive having a stepchild who does not live with them as an ambiguous gain. That is, it might be unclear to them what their role and responsibilities are towards their stepchild, and they have few opportunities for co-creating a shared reality with their stepchild due to limited opportunities for contact. Therefore, these parents might have a hard time conceptualizing what their stepfamily constitutes in the first place, and probably will not characterize their stepfamily as being particularly cohesive. In fact, it is plausible that the ambiguity of aquiring a stepchild might, in fact, imply that focal parents with nonresident stepchildren consider their stepfamily as less cohesive than focal parents who do not have any stepchildren.

In comparison, focal parents with part-time or fulltime resident stepchildren likely perceive greater extents of stepfamily cohesion than focal parents without stepchildren. For once, if focal parents' stepchild resides in their household at least part-time, family boundaries might be clearer. In fact, focal parents might only consider their child as part of the stepfamily if s/he lives in the shared household at least from time to time. Clear(er) family boundaries, in turn, positively contribute to perceptions of stepfamily cohesion. Additionally, when the stepchild resides in focal parents' current household at least part-time, they have relatively ample opportunities for engaging with their stepchild and building a meaningful relationship with them. This allows for negotitating roles and expectations, which further reinforces stepfamily bounds. Such opportunities are likely more ample in case of full-time than part-time resident stepchildren, which is why we expect that:

H2b: Focal parents with nonresident stepchildren perceive the lowest extent of stepfamily cohesion, followed by focal parents without stepchildren, focal parents with part-time resident stepchildren and, lastly, focal parents with resident stepchildren.





<!-- focal parents' current partners have stepchildren Having a stepchild means that both the focal parent and their current partner already have children (from their respective previous unions).

-> Can be a struggle to have a stepchild

BUT: both fp and cp having children -> 

-> Both are parents -> level playing field -> they know how parenting works, what is expected of them -> roles are clear. Esp fathers more involved when they have children of their own.

Most so for resident stepchildren.
-> Easiest to build a cohesive family

Less so for shared resident stepchildren and nonresident stepchildren 

Resident stepchildren
-> live in the household 
-> opportunities for engagement
-> clarity: child lives there, need to deal with it


Shared resident stepchildren
-> Same as above: sometimes there, sometimes not
-> uncertainty

Nonresident stepchildren 
    -> parents might feel guilty that their current partner's child lives elsewhere
    -> also makes it difficult to build a meaningful relationship
    -> Weird that they have a stepchild by definition but might not see it regularly 

H2b: Focal parents with residential stepchildren feel greater extents of stepfamily cohesion than, respectively, focal parents with part-time resident stepchildren, non-resident stepchildren, and those without any stepchildren.



. Furthermore,  
Nonresident parents 
-> few contact oppportunities
-> feel like they don't know the child, missing out on opportunities
-> feel they do not have much of a family, let alone a particularly cohesive one
-> esp problematic for women (go against strong motherhood norms)

Shared resident parents
-> more contact opportunities (for self, but also for stepparent!)
-> but unstable
-> child goes "in and out" of the family
-> some parents like the division between time with and without kids
-> But: switching between these modes cognitively taxing, requires a lot of coordination
-> might feel like "half a parent"?

Resident parent
-> corresponds most closely to what societal family values prescribe a family/parent should be like
-> contact opportunities with child
-> can form new stepfamily with stepparent most readily
-> So: there is stability AND lots of contact

H2: Resident parents perceive the most stepfamily cohesion, followed by part-time resident and, lastly, nonresident parents. 



Nonres parents -> few contact opportunities -> don't know their kids very well. Guilt? but: certainty

resident parent -> most intense contact with their kids -> 

shared residence -> constant fluctuation (child in and out)
    -> but also better separation of time with and without children 
    -> 

The lived expericence of 

-> in NL 
-> permeability
    -> in case of **shared residence**: time with and time without kids.
-> in case of **resident children** 

## residence stepchildren

-> having kids per se changes perception of what ones family is, though not uniformely so: strongly depends on where the child lives. 

-> Stepchildren challenging (bad) -> but how much depends on where the child lives.
    -> similar to the arguments we made above -> most contact when res, least when nonres. -> nonres: not bothered too much. 
-> so I have it the other way around 
    -> Residential stepchildren: worst, 
    -> part-time residential: bad,
    -> nonresidential: OK



-> So how do I combine these two? They literally saw the opposite?
-> OR: outline the general principles, then the H's regarding bio and stepchildren?!
    -> general principle: shared residence is less stable, it is a middle ground between non res and res
        -> with nonres stepchild -> guilt/feeling bad for the current partner(
            Danger, this argument would be about the combinations! So res
        )


-> But basically: I combine the sections on HAVING a stepchild with those of RESIDENCE of the stepchild. 


-> Do we also want to look at interactions? But that will get very complicated, many different groups... -> So maybe not for now.
